Welcome to Angiogram Sprout Extraction's documentation!
=======================================================

As a simple breakdown, the ``Driver`` intitiates a set of analysis tasks for
testing. An analysis task consists of a sample image and produces a
``SproutAnalysis`` which is printed by the ``ShollAnalysisReport``.
